## Abstract
Knowing language syntax is essential as a new developer, but just as important is understanding what software craftsmanship is.  In this session, Chad will talk about the software craftsmanship movement and why it is crucial.  Chad will also explain essential craftsmanship terms like code smells, DRY, and SOLID.  Even if you have been developing for a while, this session will be helpful to brush up on how not to be a developer but how to be a professional developer.
